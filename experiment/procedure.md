##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:

###### Step 1: Select Type of Sample Data
In the simulation step, choose between Bivariate or Bivariate Grouped data.

#### Part 1: Bivariate Data
###### Step 1.1: Enter the Number of Samples
Input the number of samples or observations collected.

###### Step 1.2: Enter Sample Data and Select Correlation Coefficient Type
Enter the sample data for each variable and select the type of correlation coefficient you want to calculate (e.g., Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient).

###### Step 1.3: Select Type of Graph
Choose the type of graph that needs to be plotted for the selected sample data. Options may include scatter plots, line plots, or other relevant graphs.

###### Step 1.4: View Graphical Representation and Correlation Coefficient Result
After completing the above steps, you can view the graphical representation of the sample data and the result for the correlation coefficient. This includes observing the selected graph and analyzing the calculated correlation coefficient.

#### Part 2: Bivariate Grouped Data
###### Step 2.1: Enter the Number of Samples
Specify the number of samples or observations collected.

###### Step 2.2: Enter Sample Data in Terms of Interval
Input the sample data in terms of intervals for each variable.

###### Step 2.3: Create and Set Frequency Table
Create and set the frequency table for the selected sample data, indicating the frequency of occurrence for each interval.

###### Step 2.4: View Correlation Coefficient Result
Click on the "Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient" button to compute the correlation coefficient based on the provided grouped data. The result for the correlation coefficient can then be viewed and analyzed.
