##### In order to perform the experiment, one needs to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, Select the type of the sample data i.e., Bivariate or Bivariate grouped.
###### Part 1: Bivariate data
###### Step 1.1:  Enter the number of the samples.
###### Step 1.2:  Enter the sample data and select the type of correlation coefficient.
###### Step 1.3:  Select the type of graph that needs to be plotted for the selected sample data.
###### Step 1.4:  Hence, the graphical representation of the sample data and the result for the correlation coefficient can be viewed. 
###### Part 2: Bivariate grouped data
###### Step 2.1:  Enter the number of the samples.
###### Step 2.2:  Enter the sample data in terms of interval.
###### Step 2.3:  Create and set the frequency table for the selected sample data.
###### Step 2.4:  Hence, click on the "Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient button" and the result for the correlation coefficient can be viewed.
