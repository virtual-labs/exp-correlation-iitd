        "a": "To create a relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "To quantify the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables.",
        "c": "To find the average of two variables.",
        "d": "To determine the difference between two variables."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The aim is not to create a relationship but to quantify and understand the existing relationship.",
        "b": "This statement is correct. The experiment aims to quantify the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables using correlation coefficients.",
        "c": "This statement is incorrect. The experiment is not concerned with finding the average of the variables.",
        "d": "This statement is incorrect. The experiment aims to quantify the relationship, not the difference between variables."

      "question": "What does a correlation coefficient of -1 indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A perfect positive correlation.",

        "a": "This statement is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.",
        "c": "This statement is correct. A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning as one variable increases, the other decreases.",
