      "question": "What is correlation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "A statistical measure that describes the causal relationship between two variables."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is correct. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, but it does not imply causation.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Correlation does not imply causation; it only measures the strength and direction of the relationship between variables."

    {
      "question": "What is the range of possible values for correlation coefficient?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "From -1 to 0",
        "b": "From -1 to 1",
        "c": "From 0 to 1",
        "d": "From 0 to 100"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The range of possible values for the correlation coefficient is from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.",
        "b": "This statement is correct. The range of possible values for the correlation coefficient is from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation."

      "question": "What is the Pearson correlation coefficient?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "A measure of the association between two categorical variables."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is correct. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. The Pearson correlation coefficient is not used to measure the association between categorical variables; it specifically measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables."

        "a": "A measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.",

        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is not a measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship; it specifically measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable.",

      "question": "What is the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "A non-parametric measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is not used to measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship; it is a non-parametric measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "This statement is correct. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a non-parametric measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables, which means it assesses the strength and direction of the relationship without assuming linearity."
