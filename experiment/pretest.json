      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. The aim is not to create a relationship but to quantify and understand the existing relationship.",

      "question": "What does a correlation coefficient measure?",

        "a": "A correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It quantifies the degree of association between the variables.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. A correlation coefficient does not determine the causal relationship between two variables, but rather indicates the strength and direction of the association."
