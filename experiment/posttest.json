      "question": "The correlation coefficient between two variables X and Y is 0.85. What does this value indicate about the relationship between X and Y?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A weak positive correlation.",
        "b": "A moderate positive correlation.",
        "c": "A strong positive correlation.",
        "d": "A perfect positive correlation."

        "a": "This answer is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of 0.85 indicates a strong positive correlation between variables X and Y, not a weak positive correlation.",
        "b": "This answer is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of 0.85 indicates a strong positive correlation between variables X and Y, not a moderate positive correlation.",
        "c": "This answer is correct. A correlation coefficient of 0.85 indicates a strong positive correlation between variables X and Y.",

      "question": "In a dataset with 15 data points, the correlation coefficient between variables P and Q is -0.72. What is the sum of the ranks of variable P in the dataset?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This answer is correct. The sum of the ranks can be calculated using the formula: Sum of Ranks = n(n + 1) / 2, where n is the number of data points. For 15 data points, Sum of Ranks = 15(15 + 1) / 2 = 120.",
        "b": "This answer is incorrect. The correct sum of ranks is 120, not 105.",
        "c": "This answer is incorrect. The correct sum of ranks is 120, not 90.",
        "d": "This answer is incorrect. The correct sum of ranks is 120, not 75."

      "question": "What is the purpose of calculating a correlation coefficient?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "To determine the causal relationship between two variables."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The purpose of calculating a correlation coefficient is to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It provides a quantitative measure of their association.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Calculating a correlation coefficient does not determine the causal relationship between two variables, but rather assesses their degree of association."

      "question": "If the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is 0.64, what percentage of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable?",
      "answers": {

        "b": "64%",
        "c": "46%",
        "d": "84%"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This answer is incorrect. The correct percentage of variation explained is 64%, not 36%.",
        "b": "This answer is correct. R-squared represents the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable. In this case, 0.64 or 64% of the variation is explained.",
        "c": "This answer is incorrect. The correct percentage of variation explained is 64%, not 46%.",
        "d": "This answer is incorrect. The correct percentage of variation explained is 64%, not 84%."

      "question": "If the p-value associated with a correlation coefficient is 0.02, is the correlation statistically significant at a 0.05 level of significance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Yes, the correlation is statistically significant.",
        "b": "No, the correlation is not statistically significant."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This answer is correct. A p-value of 0.02 is less than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that the correlation is statistically significant.",

        "a": "This statement is correct. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables. It means that as one variable increases, the other variable increases proportionally.",
