      "question": "What is the difference between correlation and causation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Correlation refers to a cause-and-effect relationship, while causation refers to a statistical association between variables.",
        "b": "Correlation refers to a statistical association between variables, while causation refers to a cause-and-effect relationship."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. Correlation does not imply causation; it simply measures the degree of association between variables.",
        "b": "Correlation measures the statistical association between variables, while causation refers to a cause-and-effect relationship where one variable directly influences another."

      "question": "You have a dataset with 200 observations and want to calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables. The result is -0.75. What does this value indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A strong positive correlation.",
        "b": "A strong negative correlation.",
        "c": "A weak positive correlation.",
        "d": "A weak negative correlation."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This answer is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of -0.75 indicates a strong negative correlation, not a strong positive correlation.",
        "b": "This answer is correct. A correlation coefficient of -0.75 indicates a strong negative correlation, meaning the variables move in opposite directions.",
        "c": "This answer is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of -0.75 indicates a strong negative correlation, not a weak positive correlation.",
        "d": "This answer is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of -0.75 indicates a strong negative correlation, not a weak negative correlation."

      "question": "You have a dataset with 300 observations and want to calculate the correlation coefficient between two variables. The result is 0.15. What does this value indicate?",

        "c": "This answer is correct. A correlation coefficient of 0.15 indicates a weak positive correlation, meaning the variables have a slight tendency to move together.",
        "d": "This answer is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of 0.15 indicates a weak positive correlation, not a weak negative correlation."

      "question": "You have a dataset with 100 observations and calculate a correlation coefficient of 0.95 between two variables. What can you conclude about their relationship?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "There is a strong positive linear relationship between the variables.",
        "b": "There is a strong negative linear relationship between the variables.",
