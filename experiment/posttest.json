      "question": "What is the purpose of calculating a correlation coefficient?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.",
        "b": "To determine the causal relationship between two variables."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The purpose of calculating a correlation coefficient is to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It provides a quantitative measure of their association.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. Calculating a correlation coefficient does not determine the causal relationship between two variables, but rather assesses their degree of association."

    {
      "question": "What does a correlation coefficient of 1 indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "There is a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables.",
        "b": "There is no linear relationship between the two variables."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is correct. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between the two variables. It means that as one variable increases, the other variable increases proportionally.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, not the absence of a linear relationship."

      "question": "Can a correlation coefficient be greater than 1?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Yes, a correlation coefficient can be greater than 1.",
        "b": "No, a correlation coefficient cannot exceed 1."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is incorrect. A correlation coefficient cannot be greater than 1. It ranges between -1 and 1, inclusive.",
        "b": "This statement is correct. A correlation coefficient cannot exceed 1. It ranges between -1 and 1, inclusive."

    {
      "question": "What does a correlation coefficient of 0.2 indicate?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "There is a weak positive linear relationship between the two variables.",
        "b": "There is a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This statement is correct. A correlation coefficient of 0.2 indicates a weak positive linear relationship between the two variables. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 0 (zero), the weaker the correlation.",
        "b": "This statement is incorrect. A correlation coefficient of 0.2 indicates a weak positive linear relationship, not a strong positive linear relationship."

      "question": "What is the correlation coefficient for a perfect negative linear relationship?",

        "a": "This statement is correct. A perfect negative linear relationship is represented by a correlation coefficient of -1.",
